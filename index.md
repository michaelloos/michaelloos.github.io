### 2007 CFB Season Analysis
The 2007 college football season was filled with upsets and nontraditional teams high in the rankings. This project uses Python and multiple data sources to wrangle and analyze data to find insights on the 2007 season. Data sources include a CSV file, website/HTML, and accessing data through an API. 

### API Weather Forecast
A simple Python program using openweathermap.org API to generate current weather conditions and forecast for a zip code or city. Users are prompted for a zip code or city. A query string is created and passed to request JSON data for current conditions and the 5 day/3 hour forecast in a user friendly display.

### CFB Betting Model
Project using Python to gather, clean, and structure data from the 2019 college football season and model a neural network. R was used for Exploratory Data Analysis and to create different logistic and linear models to predict the outcomes of games, straight up and against the spread.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection Model
Project using Python to create and assess different machine learning models for predicting whether credit card transactions are fraudulent or not using variables such as transaction amount, location, merchant type, and cardholder characteristics. Modeling methods include logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

### NBA Salary Model
Project using R and statistical methods to analyze data and generate a multiple linear regression model to predict an NBA playerâ€™s salary based on player characteristics and statistics. This project contains data gathering and cleaning, created variables, analysis of variables, linear regression modeling, and model diagnostics.  

### The Case for Air Travel-Data Visualization
This project contains several different types of projects and visualizations to persuade different audiences that air travel is safe. Visualization mediums include a dashboard, an executive summary, an infographic, a blog post, and a public presentation. Visuals were created using Tableau.

### What Makes a Good Movie-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis done to determine what attributes make a good movie. Data contains 81,273 movies from IMDB. Analysis focuses on Year, Duration, Average Vote, Votes, Budget, US Gross Income, and Meta Score.

### Image Classification-Big Ten Teams
Project using Python to gather images and classify college football related images by team within the Big Ten Conference. Convolutional Neural Networks are used to analyze the images.
